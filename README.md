# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation Project

## 📌 Overview
This project performs **Customer Segmentation** using the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm. 
The dataset used contains customer demographic and spending behavior data, allowing us to group customers into different clusters for better marketing strategies.

## 📂 Dataset
**File:** `Mall_Customers.csv`  
**Source:** Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset (Kaggle)  
**Columns:**
- `CustomerID`: Unique ID for each customer
- `Gender`: Male/Female
- `Age`: Customer age
- `Annual Income (k$)`: Annual income in thousands
- `Spending Score (1-100)`: Score assigned based on spending behavior

## 📊 Steps in the Project
1. **Data Loading** – Import the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understand the data distribution and patterns.
3. **Feature Selection** – Choose the most relevant features for clustering.
4. **Determine Optimal Clusters** – Use the Elbow Method to find the ideal number of clusters.
5. **Apply K-Means Clustering** – Train the clustering model.
6. **Visualization** – Plot clusters in 2D space and highlight centroids.
7. **Cluster Analysis** – Interpret each cluster for actionable insights.
